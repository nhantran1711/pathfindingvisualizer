# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive and educational pathfinding visualizer built from scratch using modern web technologies. This project allows users to visualize how various search and maze generation algorithms operate on a grid in real-time.

## ✨ Features

### 🔎 Pathfinding Algorithms
Visualize the inner workings of popular graph traversal algorithms:
- 🛤️ **Dijkstra's Algorithm** – guarantees the shortest path
- ⭐ **A\*** – optimizes search using heuristics
- 🌐 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – explores evenly across all directions
- 🔍 **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – explores deeply before backtracking


### 🧩 Maze Generation Algorithms
Generate structured obstacle layouts using:
- 🧱 **Recursive Division** – creates complex walls through space partitioning
- 🌲 **Binary Tree** – builds mazes with a randomized approach


## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **React** – UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first CSS for responsive design
- **TypeScript** – type safety
- **Custom Hooks & Context API** – state and logic management


## 🚀 Getting Started
